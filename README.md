# Rainbow-Table-Generator
This is a work in progress. 
The goal is to be able to generate custom Rainbow Tables.
Right now my focus is on SHA1 and MD5 hashes
Use hashimo-sha1.py to create a custom Rainbow Table for SHA1
A MD5 script will come...
A SHA1 and MD5 script to check a hash against a created table for plaintext will come..
